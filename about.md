Meta Redux is the personal blog of Bozhidar Batsov. It (somewhat) complements
and (mostly) succeeds my older blog "(think)" at <https://batsov.com>.

## About Me

I'm Bozhidar[^1] and I love computers in general and programming in
particular[^2]. My fanatic devotion to Emacs is known
world-wide. I spend a lot of my (free) time on GitHub, contributing
to various open-source Ruby, Clojure and Emacs Lisp [projects](/projects/).

The above paragraph is actually what I typically use as my bio for
[conference talks](http://batsov.com/presentations/). I love speaking at conferences
and I'm really bad at it![^3]

## About Meta Redux

This site is my attempt to share some of the things that are on my
mind with all of you, and in the mean time improve my
(non-programming) writing and communication skills.

I guess I'll mostly be writing on programming-related topics, but who knows...
Knowing me there's a high chance I won't actually write anything at all!

## About My Other Blogs

### (think)

[(think)](https://batsov.com) is my original technical blog. Meta Redux mostly
supersedes it, but I still occasionally write some short articles over at
`(think)` if I feel they don't fit my vision for Meta Redux.

### Emacs Redux

I run a separate blog focused on Emacs, that you might want to check
out as well - [Emacs Redux](http://emacsredux.com).

### HEY World

I also have a blog at [HEY World](https://world.hey.com/bozhidar).
I'm still not sure what I'll use it for (if anything), but likely it
will host short musings on random non-technical topics.

## Patronage

As you might imagine maintaining many open-source projects is a
challenging and time-consuming undertaking (from time to time it's
also quite frustrating).  While I certainly didn't get involved with
open-source for money (who in their right mind would?), some funding
is definitely rewarding, motivating and just useful.

Please, consider supporting my open-source work at one of the following patronage services:

* [GitHub Sponsors](https://github.com/sponsors/bbatsov) (**recommended**)

Note that some of my projects also have an [Open Collective](https://opencollective.com), which you might consider supporting instead of me directly:

* [CIDER](https://opencollective.com/cider)

I write all of the articles in Emacs and publish them to GitHub
pages. These days I'm a macOS user most of the time.  When I'm at home
I do all my writing on my beloved [Leopold
FC660C](https://deskthority.net/wiki/Leopold_FC660C)[^4].  When I'm on
the road I do (or don't do) my writing on a Apple Magic Keyboard or
the built-in MacBook keyboard[^5].

[^1]: Божидар in Bulgarian. I know, I know - that's both pretty hard to read and to pronounce. My friends call me Bug and so can you.
[^2]: Especially Lisps! And Unix-like operating systems! And Emacs! And video games!
[^3]: But at least I'm honest with myself.
[^4]: Also known as the "best keyboard ever". Seriously!
[^5]: Also known as the "worst keyboard ever". No shit!
