Meta Redux is the personal tech blog of Bozhidar Batsov. It (somewhat) complements
and (partially) succeeds my older blog "(think)" at <https://batsov.com>.

## About Me

I'm Bozhidar[^1] and I love computers in general and programming in
particular[^2]. My fanatic devotion to Emacs is known
world-wide. I spend a lot of my (free) time on GitHub, contributing
to various open-source Ruby, Clojure and Emacs Lisp [projects](https:/batsov.com/projects/).

The above paragraph is actually what I typically use as my bio for
[conference talks](https://batsov.com/presentations/). I love speaking at conferences
and I'm really bad at it![^3]

You can learn more about me [here](https://batsov.com/about/).

## About Meta Redux

This site is my attempt to share some of the things that are on my
mind with all of you, and in the mean time improve my
(non-programming) writing and communication skills.

The main focus of the blog are going to be my open-source work and programming.
I reserve the right to write about anything and everything if I deem fit to do so.
I also reserve the right to be lazy and not write about anything at all.

## About My Other Blogs

I have [way too many blogs]({% post_url 2020-12-12-making-sense-of-all-my-blogs %}) at this point! In hindsight, probably I went a
bit overboard with them, but it is how it is.

Generally I write here about programming and my open-source projects and most other topics end up on some of my other blogs.

### (think)

[(think)](https://batsov.com) is my original personal site/technical blog. Meta
Redux somewhat supersedes it (especially as a technical blog), but I still
occasionally write articles over at `(think)` if I feel they don't fit my vision
for Meta Redux.

### Emacs Redux

I run a separate blog focused on Emacs, that you might want to check
out as well - [Emacs Redux](http://emacsredux.com).

This blog precedes Meta Redux (I started it in 2013) and it inspired me to come
up with the Meta Redux name.

### HEY World

I also have a blog at [HEY World](https://world.hey.com/bozhidar).
I'm still not sure what I'll use it for (if anything), but likely it
will host short musings on random non-technical topics.

## Patronage

As you might imagine maintaining many open-source projects is a
challenging and time-consuming undertaking (from time to time it's
also quite frustrating).  While I certainly didn't get involved with
open-source for money (who in their right mind would?), some funding
is definitely rewarding, motivating and just useful.

Please, consider supporting my open-source work at one of the following patronage services:

* [GitHub Sponsors](https://github.com/sponsors/bbatsov) (**recommended**)
* [ko-fi](https://ko-fi.com/bbatsov)
* [Paypal](https://www.paypal.me/bbatsov)

Note that some of my projects also have an [Open Collective](https://opencollective.com), which you might consider supporting instead of me directly:

* [CIDER](https://opencollective.com/cider)

One way to support my work is to sign up for Hyvor via my [affiliate link](https://talk.hyvor.com?aff=14023).

I write all of the articles in Emacs and publish them to GitHub
pages. These days I'm a macOS user most of the time.  When I'm at home
I do all my writing on my beloved [Leopold
FC660C](https://deskthority.net/wiki/Leopold_FC660C)[^4].  When I'm on
the road I do (or don't do) my writing on a Apple Magic Keyboard or
the built-in MacBook keyboard[^5].
