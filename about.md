Hey there, stranger!

So, I'm Bozhidar[^1] and I love computers in general and programming in
particular[^2]. My fanatic devotion to Emacs is known
world-wide. I spend a lot of my (free) time on GitHub, contributing
to various open-source Ruby, Clojure and Emacs Lisp projects.

This site is my attempt to share some of the things that are on my
mind with all of you, and in the mean time improve my
(non-programming) writing and communication skills.

I guess I'll mostly be writing on programming-related topics, but who knows...
Knowing me there's a high chance I won't actually write anything at all!

[^1]: Божидар in Bulgarian. I know, I know - that's both pretty hard to read and to pronounce. My friends call me Bug and so can you.
[^2]: Especially Lisps! And Unix-like operating systems! And Emacs! And video games!
