Meta Redux is the personal blog of Bozhidar Batsov. It (somewhat) complements
and (mostly) succeeds my older blog "(think)" at <https://batsov.com>.

## About Me

I'm Bozhidar[^1] and I love computers in general and programming in
particular[^2]. My fanatic devotion to Emacs is known
world-wide. I spend a lot of my (free) time on GitHub, contributing
to various open-source Ruby, Clojure and Emacs Lisp [projects](/projects/).

The above paragraph is actually what I typically use as my bio for
[conference talks](/presentations/). I love speaking at conferences
and I'm really bad at it![^3]

## About Meta Redux

This site is my attempt to share some of the things that are on my
mind with all of you, and in the mean time improve my
(non-programming) writing and communication skills.

I guess I'll mostly be writing on programming-related topics, but who knows...
Knowing me there's a high chance I won't actually write anything at all!

## Emacs Redux

I run a separate blog focused on Emacs, that you might want to check
out as well - [Emacs Redux](http://emacsredux.com).

## Colophon

This website is powered by [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) and uses
its default [Minima theme](https://github.com/jekyll/minima).

I write all of the articles in Emacs and publish them to GitHub
pages. These days I'm a macOS user most of the time.  When I'm at home
I do all my writing on my beloved [Leopold
FC660C](https://deskthority.net/wiki/Leopold_FC660C)[^4].  When I'm on
the road I do (or don't do) my writing on a Apple Magic Keyboard or
the built-in MacBook keyboard[^5].

The source code of the site is freely available at [GitHub](https://github.com/bbatsov/metaredux).

[^1]: Божидар in Bulgarian. I know, I know - that's both pretty hard to read and to pronounce. My friends call me Bug and so can you.
[^2]: Especially Lisps! And Unix-like operating systems! And Emacs! And video games!
[^3]: But at least I'm honest with myself.
[^4]: Also known as the "best keyboard ever". Seriously!
[^5]: Also known as the "worst keyboard ever". No shit!
