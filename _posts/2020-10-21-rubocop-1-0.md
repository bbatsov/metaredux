RuboCop's development started exactly 7 and half years ago. I made
[the first
commit](https://github.com/rubocop-hq/rubocop/commit/afbead34db54506c12a21dbd4ce04fada0f8b9a4#diff-bc37d034bad564583790a46f19d807abfe519c5671395fd494d8cce506c42947)
on April 21, 2012. That's a lot of time in general, but even more in
the fast moving world of IT. During this long period we've racked up some
impressive numbers:

* **9905** commits
* **152** releases
* around **3500** closed issues
* almost **5000** merged pull requests
* over **120** million downloads
* over **200** publicly available related gems (extensions, custom configurations, etc)
* **hundreds** of contributors

I never expected any of this on April 21, 2012. If there's a person truly
surprised by the success of RuboCop that'd be me. But wait, there's more!
We also reached some important milestones in the last couple of years:

* Created the [RuboCop HQ organization](https://github.com/rubocop-hq) that became the home for RuboCop, the community style guides, and many popular RuboCop extensions
* Extracted the Rails cops to a separate gem (`rubocop-rails`)
* Extracted the performance cops to a separate gem (`rubocop-performance`)
* Extracted the AST-related functionality to a separate gem (`rubocop-ast`)
* Created new extensions focused on Rake (`rubocop-rake`) and Minitest (`rubocop-minitest`)
* Made significant improvements to RuboCop's code formatting capabilities
* Reworked the cop API
* Switched to safe-only cops by default
* Introduced the notion of "pending" cops
* Created a brand new [documentation site](https://docs.rubocop.org)
* Provided more polished versions of the community style guides over at <https://rubystyle.guide>

One thing eluded us, though - a "stable" RuboCop release. Today this finally changes with
RuboCop 1.0![^1]

There's nothing ground-breaking about the new RuboCop release - it's almost the same as RuboCop 0.93.1 that
preceded it. I believe the only change, that most of you are going to notice, is that all cops that used to be
"pending" are now enabled by default, which is in line with our release policy. No new cops will be enabled
by default until RuboCop 2.0.

The big news for end users and maintainers of extensions is that we're finally embracing fully Semantic Versioning, which
should make the upgrade process simpler (painless?) for everyone. Going forward the following things will happen only on major releases:

* enabling of new cops
* changes to the default cop configuration
* breaking API changes

It's really funny that I felt for at least a couple of years that we were very close to the 1.0
release, only to come up with more and more things I wanted to include in it. I believe [I first spoke](https://rubykaigi.org/2018/presentations/bbatsov.html)
about my intentions to ship RuboCop 1.0 at RubyKaigi 2018 and back then I truly believed this was bound to happen in the next
6 months. Classic example of planning in the software development world, right?

Many people urged me for years to label a random release as 1.0 with
the argument that if some software is useful and widely used than it
probably deserves that magic moniker. It's not a bad argument and I
totally understood the perspective of those people. I, however, was
not convinced as for me version 1.0 also stands for "we got to a place
we consider feature complete and aligned with our vision".  Needless
to say - the vision we (RuboCop's team) had was quite ambitious and it took us
a while to make it a reality.

I cannot begin to explain how happy I am that we got here, and I can
assure you that it wasn't easy.  Over the years RuboCop had its ups
and downs, it got a lot of praise, but also a lot of flak.[^2] Some
days I was super pumped and motivated to work on it, on other days I
couldn't stand to think about it.  Working on popular OSS projects is
one of the most rewarding and most frustrating experiences that one
can have.  I was (un)fortunate enough to be involved in a few of those
(RuboCop, CIDER, nREPL, Projectile, Emacs Prelude, etc) and each one
was a crazy roller-coaster ride.

I find it funny how my role in RuboCop evolved with time. Originally I
used to write mostly code, these days I write mostly tickets,
issue/code review comments and documentation. Often I feel more like a
project manager rather than a programmer. There was a time when I was
super happy to see a PR and I'd immediately respond to it, now I can't
keep up with all the PRs. In fact, our entire team can't keep up with
them, so consider this my apology that it sometimes takes a while to
get feedback on your suggestions. I'll even admit that I rarely read
issue tickets these days as there are so many of them and it's
impossible for me to respond to all of them. I've just learned that
important tickets always get noticed, if not by me than by someone else from our
fantastic team.

I want to extend special thanks to RuboCop's core team, as we would have never gotten so far without all those amazing people
working tirelessly on the project:

* [Jonas Arvidsson](https://github.com/jonas054)
* [Yuji Nakayama](https://github.com/yujinakayama) (retired)
* [Evgeni Dzhelyov](https://github.com/edzhelyov) (retired)
* [Ted Johansson](https://github.com/drenmi)
* [Masataka Kuwabara](https://github.com/pocke)
* [Koichi Ito](https://github.com/koic)
* [Maxim Krizhanovski](https://github.com/darhazer)
* [Benjamin Quorning](https://github.com/bquorning)
* [Marc-André Lafortune](https://github.com/marcandre)

You rock, guys!

Jonas, in particular, deserves just as much credit for RuboCop existing today as me. He was the first contributor to RuboCop and he
pushed me to get RuboCop to the state where it got critical mass, mindshare and some traction. It's a long story for another day and another article.[^3]

Koichi also deserves a special mention for his tireless work and incredible dedication to RuboCop and its users over the years! And for his great karaoke skills!
He has also been a fantastic head maintainer for key RuboCop extensions like `rubocop-rails`, `rubocop-performance` and `rubocop-minitest`.

Last, but not least - another round of big thanks for all the people who contributed to RuboCop in any capacity over the years! RuboCop is all of you!
Keep those contributions coming!

Some closing notes:

* As mentioned above, recently we've extracted RuboCop's AST-related logic to the [rubocop-ast](https://github.com/rubocop-hq/rubocop-ast) gem, that's going to be very handy for everything looking to supercharge
[parser](https://github.com/whitequark/parser)'s API. I'd love to see more tools using it, as I think we really manage to simplify the interaction with an AST. Work on the new gem is led by the awesome Marc-André Lafortune.
* The cop API was completely reworked recently by Marc-André. He did some truly fantastic work there! Check out the [upgrade notes](https://docs.rubocop.org/rubocop/v1_upgrade_notes.html) if you maintain any RuboCop extensions, as the legacy API will be removed
in RuboCop 2.0.
* We've made some changes to how department names are calculated that might affect some extensions. Read more about them [here](https://github.com/rubocop-hq/rubocop/pull/8490).
* Check out the [release notes](https://github.com/rubocop-hq/rubocop/releases/tag/v1.0.0) for all the details.

And that's a wrap! Enjoy RuboCop 1.0 and share with us your feedback about it! Our focus now shifts to RuboCop 1.1, and I hope that we'll be dropping
new major releases rather infrequently going forward (although RuboCop 2.0 will probably arrive in less than 7 years). Thanks for your help, love, feedback and
support! Keep hacking!
