Another year is almost behind us and I guess it's time for all of us
to take some time to look back on it. For me 2018 was a pretty mixed
year both professionally and personally.  On one hand I finally
managed to re-ignite my desire to work on OSS projects and I've
managed to get a lot done on so many projects, but on the other hand I
ran into some health issues, combined with burnout, and I've started
pondering a lot about the meaning of everything that I'm doing (and
the meaning of life in general). Yeah, yeah - I'm one deep and
profound individual. I know.

I guess most of my dear
readers care only about the things I've done on the OSS front, so I'll
focus on them first. Without a doubt the thing that consumed most of
my spare time and my energy this year was Clojure tooling (CIDER,
nREPL and all the [related projects]({% post_url
2018-11-09-ciders-orchard-the-heart %}).  I'm also quite happy that I
managed to find some time for RuboCop and Projectile and both projects
made some significant strides throughout the year. And, of course, I
finally resurrected my blogging efforts in the form of _Meta Redux_.

I won't really repeat everything major I've done throughout the year here. I'll just mention the things
I'm proudest of:

* The big cleanup of the internals of CIDER 0.18
* [Saving nREPL from Clojure Contrib and reviving its development](({% post_url 2018-10-29-nrepl-redux %}))
* Coming up with a solid plan for RuboCop 1.0 and growing the team around the project
* Releasing for the first time a 1.0 version a major project of mine (Projectile) and the subsequent improvements
for the upcoming Projectile 2.0


I've also realized this year that I'm at a point where I can't
adequately work on all the projects I've started and pursue all the
ideas I have. This meant that I had to decide what matters the most to
me and focus my energies there. It also meant some of my projects were
not well supported anymore, but I can live with this.  I don't know
what my focus for the next year is going to be. Time will tell.

By the way, I'm more and more convinced that good documentation is
crucial for the success of every project, so I've invested a lot of
time in documentation efforts like [nrepl.org](https://nrepl.org),
[cider.mx](https://www.cider.mx) and
[projectile.mx](https://www.projectile.mx). I understand that the
results are still not great, but given all the constraints I had to
deal with, I'm quite satisfied with them. One of the big revelations
for me this year was how awesome [AsciiDoc](http://asciidoc.org/) is!
Going forward I hope to use it more in my documentation
endeavours. I've also become quite fond of the
[Antora](https://antora.org/) documentation publishing system and I
can heartily recommend to everyone looking for something like this.

To wrap up the OSS subject - 2018 was the first year in which I
managed to make some money from my OSS work.  RuboCop and CIDER
received more or less the same funding throughout the year (mostly
donations, plus a grant from Clojurists Together for some work on
CIDER). I'm extremely thankful to every company and individual who
contributed funds and I want you to know that I really appreciate
this! Unfortunately the donations were still a drop in the pond in the
grand scheme of things, but I hope the situation will improve down the
road.  As many people discussed with me ideas for funding projects
like RuboCop, CIDER and nREPL I've been ruminating a lot on the
subject and I'll likely write another blog post about this.

This year I've attended fewer conferences than before and I gave only
a handful of talks. Without a doubt the best conference I've visited
this year was [ClojuTRE](https://clojutre.org/2019/) and I can highly
recommend it to everyone who's into Clojure.  I also had a lot of fun
meeting the awesome members of the Ruby development community at
[RubyKaigi](https://rubykaigi.org/2019) and reconnecting with many old friends at
[Clojure/conj](clojure-conj.org) and [Clojure
X](https://skillsmatter.com/conferences/11936-clojure-exchange-2019). I'm a bit disappointed with my lack of
inspiration for talks this year, but it is what it is - hopefully next
year would be better in this regard.  I've got a lot of ideas, but I'm
finding it hard to channel my thoughts into something worth sharing
with a bigger crowd.

In the area of learning and self-improvement I didn't do much this
year. My grand plans to master Erlang and Haskell went nowhere (as
usual), as did my plans to spend more time developing my software
architecture skills. On the bright side, I did spend a lot of time
honing my managerial and leadership skills and I think I've never been
a better manager (which is not the same as being certain I'm a good
manager).  There's always this struggle in me between my love for
programming itself and my love for working with many people,
leading teams, projects, etc. Finding the balance is pretty challenging and
pushing yourself hard in both directions can be extremely stressful
and exhausting. Probably at some point in the future I'll have to
focus just on one or the other, but I hope this moment is at least a
couple of years into the future.

I didn't do much with my hobbies this year - zero progress playing the
guitar or learning Spanish. That was a bit disappointing, but not
unexpected given my workload and traveling schedule. On the bright
side - I did have many wonderful trips and I've visited a few new (for
me) countries, namely Cambodia, Vietnam, Japan, Norway, Azerbaijan and
Malta. All of them were spectacular and you can't go wrong by choosing
to visit any one of them. Fun things I learned on my trips - in Norway
August is a rainy month and doesn't feel much like summer and in
Azerbaijan people consider 25 degrees Celsius in the September a cold
weather for the beach.  I also got to spend more time in my beloved
Andalucia (a region in Southern Spain) this year and I'm now more
convinced than ever that it's one of the best places for living (at
least for someone like me). If I ever decide to leave Bulgaria,
Andalucia will be at the top of my list.

Sports-wise my year was a complete zero, but at least I learned to swim
(somewhat) at the age of 33 (now 34). I'd like to do more of this
and maybe ever learn to do it right. Same with favourite past-time - reading
and watching TV shows and movies. I watched few series and movies this year
and this left me feeling a bit empty. I read very few non-fiction books
and this had exactly the same effect. I just got a new Kindle as a
Christmas gift for myself and I certainly plan to change this. I already
read more books this month than in the entire year combined.

What about the famous New Year resolutions? I don't have anything
particular on my mind, as of today. I'll definitely try to do some of
the following:

* live a healthier (and less stressful life)
* learn Erlang and Haskell properly (again)
* find some time for the guitar and the Spanish
* look into personal finance management (FOREX, stock markets, etc)
* visit 5+ new countries
* read 20-30 fiction books
* read 5-10 non-fiction books (mostly on management and leadership)
* become a better human being (that's always the hardest thing to do, right?)


I guess that's all from me for now. I sincerely hope that you had a much better year than me and you've got some really awesome plans lined up for 2019!

Live long and prosper!
