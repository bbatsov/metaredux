This tweet made my day:

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">If the Clojure community ever created a Clojure Hero award (like the Ruby Hero Awards) my nominees would be <a href="https://twitter.com/ztellman?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@ztellman</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/bbatsov?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@bbatsov</a>, and <a href="https://twitter.com/weavejester?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@weavejester</a> - wonderful people whom I&#39;ve learned a lot from and who have given tremendously to the community :-)</p>&mdash; Daniel Higginbotham (@nonrecursive) <a href="https://twitter.com/nonrecursive/status/1138095207113744384?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">June 10, 2019</a></blockquote>

It's a great reminder of how awesome the Clojure community is. I was truly touched by the tweet (as I didn't really expect it, plus I was
having a pretty bad day) and I already feel like I've won the "Clojure Hero" award! Thanks for the kind words, Daniel! I'm honoured and humbled to be on your list![^1]

This all reminded me that we often don't value enough the people who make Clojure so awesome. Let me address this today by "nominating" three more Clojurians for the "Clojure Hero" award:

* [Chas Emerick](https://github.com/cemerick)
* [Phil Hagelberg](https://github.com/technomancy)
* [Christophe Grand](https://github.com/cgrand)

I'm reasonably certain they need no introduction and that most of you are well aware of their huge impact on the Clojure community. I'll just say "Thank you! You're awesome! Clojure wouldn't not be the same without you!".

Last, but not least - a very big "Thanks!" to Rich, Stu Halloway, Alex Miller, David Nolen and everyone else on Clojure(Script)'s team. There wouldn't be a Clojure community without you![^2]

So, who are your nominees for the "Clojure Hero" award? Why don't you reach out to them and let them know how much you value their contributions to the Clojure community? I'm sure that small gesture is going to brighten
their days as well.

[^1]: And you're certainly on mine.
[^2]: I'm pretty sure they are on everyone's list. :-)
