I've started "Meta Redux" on my birthday [one year ago]({% post_url 2018-10-13-going-meta %}).
I had plenty of ambitious goals when I kicked off the new blog and now it's time to examine
how well I've done with respect to them.

In total I wrote 52 articles, which conveniently means that on average I wrote one
article per week. That's way more than I used to be writing on [the old
blog](https://batsov.com) before retiring it, so I'm reasonably happy with
myself. As usual, however, there's plenty of room for improvement.  For
one, I planned to write more essay-like articles in the spirit of [nREPL Redux]({%
post_url 2018-10-29-nrepl-redux %}) and [Ruby's Creed]({% post_url
2019-04-02-ruby-s-creed %}), but I ended up writing way more release announcements, tutorials and short
articles instead. I also wrote pretty much nothing that wasn't related to
programming. I really want to change this down the road, as (believe it or not) I'm passionate
about more things in life than programming.[^1]

One area where I miserably failed were my journal series "Meta Reduce".  I set
out to do one article per week and I ended up doing less than one per month. On
the bright side - that's the only area where I managed to share some
non-programming related thoughts. I also really struggled to find the right
structure for those, but I'm sure I'll get there eventually.

Another (small) failure - "Meta Redux" consumed most of my writing time and energy
and this impacted negatively my other blog, [dedicated to Emacs](https://emacsredux.com).
I guess it's no secret that I'm crazy about Emacs and I love writing about it,
so I'm quite displeased with how things went down there. I'll have to find
some kind of balance between the two of them going forward.

So, what's next?  This year I've been spending a lot of time playing with
[Objectives and Key Results](https://felipecastro.com/en/okr/what-is-okr/) and
I've been trying to put more of the things I'm doing in the OKR
framework. That's how I see my "Meta Redux" OKRs for the upcoming year:

**Objective:** Share my interesting thoughts and ideas with a broader audience.

**Key Results:**

* Publish 1 "Meta Reduce" article per month.
* Publish 10 essays.
* Publish 10 non-programming articles.
* Publish 64 articles in total.
* Double the number of unique visitors to the site.

Nothing super ambitious here, but now that I've put the goals in writing it's much easier to measure my
success with achieving them.

Now for some random observations:

* I've rarely written anything while traveling. I'm really struggling with writing when I don't have a comfortable desk
and a real keyboard. Not to mention I have the laptop with the worst keyboard in the world...
* I've started way more articles than I actually finished.
* I spend more time editing something than I spend writing the initial draft.[^2]
* Switching back to Jekyll from Octopress really helped. Hooray for simple
tools! I tried at some point using Hugo, but I found its tool-chain to be more
complex than Jekyll's. That's partially related to my background as a Ruby
developer, but it has more to do with the fact that the initial process of setting up a Hugo
blog and customizing a theme there is more involved.
* It's really hard to find nice looking, free and well-maintained Jekyll themes. Most of the famous themes
seem to be abandoned or with 20 competing forks. That's a bummer, but at least the default Minima theme
is quite compatible with my sense of aesthetics.
* Writing some simple Jekyll helpers for Emacs (e.g. to link to another article) was a real productivity booster.
* My readers are much better proofreaders than me.

In the end of the day, however, for me the most important thing is that I'm happy with "Meta Redux".
It feels great to share my thoughts in writing. For some crazy
reason I genuinely believe I've learned some importantly things in life (and on
the job) that might be useful to others. I hope you enjoy my ramblings as much
as I enjoy producing them! Until next time!
