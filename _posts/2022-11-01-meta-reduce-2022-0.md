Lately I haven't written much here, so I thought it'd be nice to change this
with a short update on my recent OSS activity.

## RuboCop

After a couple of slow months, where I had a lot of work and work-related travel
on my hands, I'm now back in action on the RuboCop front. I've cut several
releases relatively quickly, the most recent of which (1.38) -
[today](https://github.com/rubocop/rubocop/releases/tag/v1.38.0).

I've been pondering more and more lately about the exact scope and timeline of
RuboCop 2.0, so I hope I'll have something concrete to share before the end of
the year.

## nREPL & CIDER

It has been relatively quiet on the nREPL & CIDER front lately. Still, there are a few updates worth sharing:

- nREPL 1.1 will have support for TLS (see <https://nrepl.org/nrepl/usage/tls.html>)
- CIDER is going to get much smarter about stacktraces (see <https://github.com/clojure-emacs/cider-nrepl/pull/758>)

A new library called [haystack](https://github.com/clojure-emacs/haystack),
that's dedicated to stacktrace analysis, will be joining the ranks of CIDER's
Orchard soon.

## Projectile

I've been spending a bit more on Projectile recently, as a lot of tasks had piled up. I'm really happy with the recent progress:

- [Projectile 2.6](https://github.com/bbatsov/projectile/releases/tag/v2.6.0) is out with a ton of small improvements
- Projectile 2.7 is right around the corner with some cool improvements like `project.el` integration and basic support for finding references in a project (see `projectile-find-references).

Probably I should be doing smaller releases more frequently. I keep forgetting to do this, mostly because I'm constantly running the latest snapshot.
This [recent reddit discussion](https://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/ydenz5/what_killer_features_make_you_prefer_projectile/) got me a bit fired up and I
plan to write some follow-up blog post on the merits of having choices and competition within every community.

Projectile continues to be one of my favorite OSS projects and the one I use the most, so I'd love to spend a bit more quality time with it
and address some of the things I've wanted to add/improve for a while. My dream is to find enough time to rework the caching to use a file
for each project instead of a single file for all projects.

## Everything else

Not much to report here. Part of the reason for my reduced OSS project activity
is that I've been spending a lot of time [playing with
OCaml](https://batsov.com/articles/2022/08/29/ocaml-at-first-glance/). You'll
find a few more OCaml articles on the subject on my "(think)" blog.[^1]

I did manage to contribute a bit to some Emacs plugins for OCaml development (e.g. `utop.el`, `flycheck-ocaml` and `tuareg`)
and to [OCamlverse](https://ocamlverse.net/) already, and I hope to do a bit
of actual OCaml OSS hacking down the road as well.

I've also decided to modernize a bit my Zsh setup and I've started using things
like [powerline10k](https://github.com/romkatv/powerlevel10k) and
[z](https://github.com/agkozak/zsh-z). It's always fun to tweak my Zsh setup.

And last, but not least - fun with hardware! I've bought a new M2-power MacBook
Air recently and I've been playing with it a bit. This laptop is the stuff of
legends! It's faster than my desktop PC (at least according to Geekbench), but
it never gets warm and the battery lasts for days. There's no such thing as
the perfect laptop, but this one gets pretty damn close!

And let's not forget to mention the
["fun"](https://batsov.com/articles/2022/10/30/lessons-learned-from-a-hardware-upgrade-gone-wrong/)
I've had with my desktop PC recently.

## Wrap up

That's all I have for you today. I hope I'll have more cool updates to share next time!
