Today I've released [nREPL 1.1.1](https://github.com/nrepl/nrepl/releases/tag/v1.1.1) with a couple of small bug-fixes and one more notable, if mostly invisible change.

Historically nREPL's `completions` op (introduced in [nREPL 0.8]({% post_url
2020-06-15-nrepl-0-8-evolving-the-protocol %})) used internally a modified
version of [clojure-complete](https://github.com/ninjudd/clojure-complete), that
I eventually released as a library named
[incomplete](https://github.com/nrepl/incomplete). `clojure-complete` was pretty
much abadonware at this point and I wanted a simple drop-in replacement that we
could use in tools like REPLy (and by association - Leiningen).[^1]

Using the much better
[compliment](https://github.com/alexander-yakushev/compliment) library wasn't an
option, as we needed something that was quite literally a single file. (so it'd
be easy to inline in nREPL and load in REPLy) Recently, however, `compliment`'s
author Oleksandr Yakushev released exactly what we needed - a single-file,
stripped-down version of `compliment` called
[compliment-lite](https://github.com/alexander-yakushev/compliment/tree/master/lite). Here's how it differs from the full-fledged `compliment`:

- *Context*. Completion features that require context (e.g., filtering methods by the class of the receiver object) don't work.
- *Local bindings and resources*. Those two sources of completions completely rely on context, so they are disabled in Compliment-lite.
- *Documentation*. The `documentation` function is absent from Compliment-lite.

None of those were things supported by `incomplete`, so nothing lost.
Naturally, it made sense for nREPL to adopt it and offer improved out-of-the-box
completion experience to Clojure programmers. As this doesn't affect the public
API of nREPL[^2] I've opted to ship this change in a "bug-fix" release. A version like
1.1.1 is just too cool to pass up!

In light of the creation of `compliment-lite` I now consider `incomplete` to be
obsolete and I'd encourage everyone looking for a simple, but capable code-completion
library to go for `compliment-lite` instead.

That's all I have for you today. Keep hacking!
