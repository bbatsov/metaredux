It's been a while since Flycheck 35, but [Flycheck
36](https://github.com/flycheck/flycheck/releases/tag/v36.0) is finally here!
This is a pretty big release with a lot of new features, bug fixes, and some
much-needed cleanup of legacy checkers.

In fact, I'd say it's the biggest and most important Flycheck release since I
became the project's primary maintainer a couple of years ago. For a while I had
mostly gone with the flow (adding/improving linters and fixing bugs), but by now
I feel more confident to make bigger and bolder changes.

Anyways, you're probably interested to learn more about Flycheck 36, so let me
walk you through the highlights.

## New Checkers

We've added a couple of new checkers:

- `javascript-oxlint` -- a checker using [oxlint](https://oxc.rs/), the
  blazing-fast JavaScript/TypeScript linter written in Rust. If you haven't
  tried oxlint yet, you really should -- it's impressively fast.
- `org-lint` -- an Org mode checker using Emacs' built-in
  [`org-lint`](https://orgmode.org/manual/Org-Syntax.html). It detects issues
  like invalid links, dead links, and duplicate IDs. This one went through a
  rewrite mid-cycle to run in the current Emacs process instead of a `--batch`
  subprocess, which eliminates false warnings for source block languages
  provided by external packages.

## Security

We've mitigated
[CVE-2024-53920](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-53920) in the
`emacs-lisp` checker by disabling local eval directives and restricting local
variables to safe values during byte-compilation. This was an important fix --
byte-compilation involves macro expansion, which means untrusted Elisp files
could potentially execute arbitrary code during syntax checking. A follow-up fix
for Emacs 30+ using `trusted-content` is in the works.[^1]

## ShellCheck Improvements

The [`sh-shellcheck`](https://www.shellcheck.net/) checker got some love in this release:

- New `flycheck-shellcheck-infer-shell` option to let ShellCheck auto-detect the shell dialect
- `flycheck-shellcheck-args` for passing extra command-line arguments
- `flycheck-shellcheck-enabled-checks` to enable optional checks via `--enable`

## Quality-of-Life Improvements

A bunch of small but welcome improvements:

- `flycheck-command-map` now works as a prefix command with `keymap-set` and friends -- no more need for the `define-key` workaround
- Buffers are automatically re-checked after `revert-buffer`, so `global-auto-revert-mode` users get up-to-date diagnostics without manual intervention
- The mode-line indicator now includes info-level errors (format: `errors|warnings|infos`)
- The [`python-ruff`](https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/) checker got an error explainer, so you can quickly look up what a rule means
- [Pyright](https://github.com/microsoft/pyright) rule names (like `reportGeneralTypeIssues`) now show up as error IDs

## Bug Fixes

This release includes a massive number of bug fixes -- over 25 of them. Some highlights:

- Fixed error pattern matching in non-English locales by forcing `LC_ALL=C` for checker processes
- Fixed the `rust` checker on Windows (no more `/dev/null` errors)
- Fixed `flycheck-navigation-minimum-level` being ignored in some cases
- Fixed compilation warnings on Emacs 30
- Fixed several issues with the `python-ruff`, [`tex-chktex`](https://www.nongnu.org/chktex/), `emacs-lisp`, and `awk-gawk` checkers

## Spring Cleaning

We've removed a number of checkers for tools that have been dead or deprecated for years:

- `typescript-tslint` (deprecated since 2019, use [ESLint with typescript-eslint](https://typescript-eslint.io/))
- `sass`, `scss`, `sass/scss-sass-lint`, `scss-lint` (Ruby Sass is dead, use [Stylelint](https://stylelint.io/))
- `eruby-erubis`, `eruby-ruumba` ([Erubis](https://github.com/kwatch/erubis) abandoned since 2011)
- `css-csslint` (abandoned since ~2017, use Stylelint)
- `coffee-coffeelint`, `protobuf-prototool`, `nix-linter`

If you're still using any of these tools... well, it's probably time to upgrade!

## Documentation Site

[flycheck.org](https://www.flycheck.org) got a visual refresh -- we've switched
from the old Alabaster Sphinx theme to [Furo](https://pradyunsg.me/furo/), which
gives the site a clean, modern look with proper dark mode support and better
mobile responsiveness. We've also added prominent GitHub links at the top of
every page, making it easier to jump to the source or file issues.

I hate the old theme, so this one is a major win in my book! I've also took some
effort to make sure the documentation accurately reflects the current state of project,
as here and there things were out-of-sync.

## Flycheck is Alive and Well

I know that many people wrote Flycheck off when Flymake got tight integration
with Eglot (they share a maintainer, after all), and I understand why -- it's
hard to compete with something that's built into Emacs and "just works" out of
the box. But Flycheck continues to advance and evolve. We have excellent Eglot
support via [flycheck-eglot](https://github.com/flycheck/flycheck-eglot), a
massive library of built-in checkers,[^2] and a feature set that Flymake still
can't match in many areas.

More importantly, Flycheck's biggest strength has always been that it's
community-driven and easy to contribute to. Adding a new checker is
straightforward, PRs get reviewed quickly, and you don't have to go through the
FSF copyright assignment process. That matters, and it's why the project keeps
growing.

## Epilogue

I'm pretty happy with this release. The combination of new features, security
hardening, and cleanup of dead checkers puts Flycheck in a much healthier
state. Looking ahead to Flycheck 37, I'm thinking about tree-sitter integration,
more new checkers (OCaml and Swift are already in the pipeline), and potentially
dropping support for Emacs 27 so we can take advantage of newer APIs.
The plan is still hazy, but it's starting to take some shape...

As always, contributions are very welcome! If there's a lint tool you use that
Flycheck doesn't support yet, PRs are the fastest way to make it happen.
As mentioned above, Flycheck's biggest strength remains its community, and are
the community.

That's all I have for you today. Keep hacking!
