Since the beginning of time certain people have been unhappy with RuboCop's defaults.
I guess that's one of the universal truth in life - no matter how hard you try you can
never please everyone. Especially the users of a lint tool.

Still, with RuboCop 1.0 just around the corner, I've decided to run a [short survey](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSe3uTB_E164hgGUaM5-DFuIVBgv7l18ub2lAU5gXmw1dw4vPQ/viewform?usp=sf_link) so we
can see if some defaults really don't make sense. The survey covers only the topics that I remember had generated
the most heated discussions throughout the years (e.g. single-quoted vs double-quoted strings), but I've also added an open-ended question that allows you to share
whatever else frustrations you might have with the default configuration.

We've avoided changing the defaults in the past couple of years (part of our general effort to reduce the friction of RuboCop's upgrades) and we'll really limit those after RuboCop 1.0. It seems that's our final opportunity to make some sweeping changes and
make people royally pissed.

I'll leave the survey open for a couple of weeks and might potentially extend the list of questions if I notice some trends
in the answers to the open-ended question. Please, share the survey around - the more responses we get, the better our actions are going to be.
That's everyone's simplest way to influence the future direction of RuboCop!

That's all I have for you today! Keep hacking!
