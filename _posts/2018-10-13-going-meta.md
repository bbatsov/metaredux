Writing is hard. As is naming stuff.[^1]

`Meta Redux` is a re-boot of my blogging endeavours that failed
miserably so far due to a combination of poor choice of tools and lack of
vision, time, and writing skills. I believe this time around I got the
tooling[^2] and the vision right, but I can make no promises about the rest.

Back in the day I wanted to write just for the sake of writing. And maybe with the hope
that my posts were going to bring me fame and glory. Today I feel that I've got a lot
of really interesting thoughts worth sharing on my mind and I hope that this blog is
going to be a useful creative outlet. I don't really care at this point whether
I'll actually get any readers (although I won't mind some), but I care a lot about the
things I'll share with you. Perhaps I've grown older and wiser. I'm pretty certain about
the **older** part.

Today happens to be my birthday, so
this new blog is a small gift to both me and you.

They say the third time is a charm, so fingers crossed...
