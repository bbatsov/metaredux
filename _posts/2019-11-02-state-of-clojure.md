One of the hardest things for any project author is to figure out
whether their perspective on a project is aligned with perspective
of the project's users. I'm often guessing what people need and would
find useful, what their issues are and what tools are they using.
From time to time I guess right, but often I guess wrong.
A couple of notable examples immediately come to my mind.

I always assumed that people didn't care much about the minimum supported
Emacs version, as it's pretty easy to upgrade Emacs, so I was dropping support
for older Emacsen quite aggressively. Last year, however, I got some feedback
after my "Clojurists Together" funding round that people who were working
in corporate environments were really suffering, because they couldn't upgrade
the software on their machines. I was enlightened.

I always assumed that people don't care much about changing the keybindings of some commands
and I was doing this quite a lot in the early days of the project. Now I know better...

Similarly when I introduced `cider-nrepl` many years ago I thought that having
people set it up manually won't be a big deal, and I gross underestimated how
complex this tasks was for many people.

At some point I foolishly believed that everyone read CIDER's manual before starting to use it.
If only that were true! :-)

I've always loved the concept of surveys like "State of Clojure" and the insight
they bring. I've meant to do something similar for CIDER for quite a while now -
probably for at least 5 years. For one reason or another, however, this task
just kept sitting in my backlog. Until today...

Please, allow to me to introduce to you the first ever [State of CIDER
survey](https://forms.gle/TJMVMEgUrNew1Cf8A)!  It's far from perfect, but it's a
start. I'd really like to connect with more of you - the people who are actually
using CIDER. I want to understand what's the environment you're working in, I
want to learn what's your background and how are you using CIDER. I want to
learn what do you like and what do you hate. Long story short - I want to align
the things I'm working on with your needs.

I also want to get a feeling for how many people would be consider supporting
the project financially down the road.  I'm hoping to inspire a few more
companies and individuals to pitch in to our
[OpenCollective](https://opencollective.com/cider) and [GitHub
Sponsors](https://github.com/sponsors/bbatsov) campaigns. I'm a dreamer, but I'm
not the only one...

The survey will be open until the end of next week. Looking forward to your responses!
