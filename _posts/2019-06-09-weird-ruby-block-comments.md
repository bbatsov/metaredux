Welcome to another installment of "Weird Ruby"! Today we're going to be
discussing the typically boring subject of code comments. I guess pretty
much every Ruby developer knows that comments in Ruby start with `#` and
typically look something like this:

``` ruby
# I'm a comment.
```

That's not the whole story, though. Ruby actually has a second syntax for comments,
which is focused on block (multi-line) comments. Here's how it looks:

``` ruby
# I'm a plain old multi-line comment.
# You've probably seen a million like me.

=begin
I'm a block comment.
I look kind of weird and you've probably never
seen one like me before.
=end
```

So, what's so weird about this syntax that it made it to "Weird Ruby"? After all other
programming languages have the block comments as well.[^1] It's pretty simple -
the block comment syntax has the weird requirement that the comments have to
begin **at the very start** of each line. Consider this:

``` ruby
class SomeClass
=begin
This is a block comment.
It looks pretty out of place.
=end
  def some_method
  end
end

# Don't do this at home!
class SomeClass
  =begin
  This looks like a block comment, right?
  Unfortunately it's a syntax error.
  =end
  def some_method
  end
end
```

Bummer! As you can imagine this really limits the usefulness of the block comment syntax and
probably this is the reason why it never gained any traction. I've got no idea why
the syntax was designed in a such a limiting manner, or if Ruby's Core Team plans to address or remove it down the road.
If someone knows something on the subject - please, share your insight via a comment.
The good thing is that in the era of today's super powerful editors and IDEs you don't really
lose much, as they make it really easy to (un)comment blocks of code. Perhaps we no longer
need a special block comment syntax at all?

That's all I have for you today! Hopefully it was weird enough, fun and somewhat useful!
Keep hacking!

**Update (2019-06-10)**

A couple of people commented that this was not a really a block comment syntax, but more of
an attempt to emulate Perl's [POD](https://perldoc.perl.org/perlpod.html) documentation system.
In hindsight that makes a lot of sense given the massive Perl heritage that exists in Ruby today.
Funny enough I used be a Perl programmer at the beginning of my career, but I had forgotten the
POD syntax completely by now.

Turns out there's an [rdtool](https://github.com/uwabami/rdtool) for Ruby that's pretty similar to POD.
Basically `rdtool` scans a file for `=begin` and `=end{=begin...=end@{=begin` pairs, and
extracts the text between them all. This text is assumed to be documentation in
[RD format](https://github.com/uwabami/rdtool/blob/master/doc/rd-draft.rd).
You can read more about it
[here](https://ruby-doc.com/docs/ProgrammingRuby/html/rdtool.html).

There's very little documentation on `rdtool` online and I couldn't find any real-world usage of it.
I assume it predated the rise of RDoc and YARD and was effectively obsoleted by them.
Anyways, it's safe to say that this installment of "Weird Ruby" was pretty educational for me!
