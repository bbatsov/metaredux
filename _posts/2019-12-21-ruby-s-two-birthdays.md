*This article is part of the ["Meta Advent 2019"]({% post_url 2019-12-01-meta-advent-2019 %}) series. I've committed to writing
a new blog post here every day until Christmas.*

Did you know that Ruby has two birthdays? I've always been a bit confused that some people
think Ruby's birthday is somewhere in 1993 and others believe it's in 1995. I'm fairly
certain that some days I believe Ruby's birthday is in 1993 and on others - in 1995. Still,
I never took the time to look into this matter, until I saw this tweet by Matz earlier today:

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">The Ruby&#39;s official &quot;Birthday&quot; is February 24th, 1993 (when the development started). Today is the 24th anniversary of the release.</p>&mdash; Yukihiro Matsumoto (@yukihiro_matz) <a href="https://twitter.com/yukihiro_matz/status/1208171810262417408?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 20, 2019</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

Turns out Ruby has two birthdays:

* February 24th, 1993 (the start of Ruby's development)
* December 21st, 1995 (Ruby's first public release)

In this spirits of Ronald Reagan's favourite proverb "Trust, but verify" I've decided to dig quickly into this and
I learned a bit more on the subject.
Here's one curious fact - Ruby's first public release wasn't 1.0, but rather 0.95.
Depending on your perspective and the significance you place on Ruby 1.0, you can
even say Ruby has a third birthday - December 25th, 1996. Seems that was the release
that started the tradition to do major Ruby releases on Christmas day.[^1]

If you'd like to know more about Ruby's early history I'd recommend checking out
[this short article](http://blog.nicksieger.com/articles/2006/10/20/rubyconf-history-of-ruby/) on the subject.
There's a lot of cool trivia there - e.g. the history of the language's name.

That's all I have for you today!
Happy birthday, Ruby! We've had our ups and downs through the past 13 years, but I still love you![^2]

[^1]: This tradition has some exceptions, though, [Ruby 2.0](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/news/2013/02/24/ruby-2-0-0-p0-is-released/).
