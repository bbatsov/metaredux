I'm not some ninja pro rock-star conference speaker, but I do the occasional
tech talk here and there, and from time to time they don't even suck!

## The Greatest Hits

Here's a list of talks where I feel a did a bit better than average:

* [Ruby 4: To Infinity and Beyond](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aFSuXUXRySc) (EuRuKo 2018)
* [The Evolution of the Clojure Tooling for Emacs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4X-1fJm25Ww&) (Clojure/conj 2014)
* [CIDER: Inside the Brewery](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8wLwbpCxRf0) (Clojure/west 2016)
* [Towards Awesome Clojure Documentation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nrpsMB2gYI0) (ClojuTRE 2017)
* [The Elements of Style in Programming](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2Mp-OCPPIY) (WebCamp Zagreb 2015)

I really hope that I had some other good talks, but I completely forgot about those after
a proper conference afterparty!

### In Bulgarian

My ability to express myself in English is somewhat limited, so when I want to share something
really deep and profound with the world I have to do in the Bulgarian.[^1]

* [The Books That Every Programmer Must Read](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6OQ2RESp4s) (HackConf 2015)
* [How to Teach Ourselves to Program in 10+ Years](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B54nJHzXK1g) (HackConf 2016)

## Everything Else

You can find slides for most of my talks on [SpeakerDeck](https://speakerdeck.com/bbatsov).

If you google long enough you might find videos for some of them
(usually on YouTube).
