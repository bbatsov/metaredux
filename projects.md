I love free software and I do a fair share of work on free software projects.
Most of my projects are in the realms of Clojure, Ruby and Emacs and aim to
help software engineers be more productive.

My projects are spread over several GitHub accounts:

* [Personal Projects](https://github.com/bbatsov)
* [RuboCop HQ](https://github.com/rubocop-hq)
* [Clojure Emacs](https://github.com/clojure-emacs)
* [nREPL](https://github.com/nrepl)

## Highlights

Here's a brief run-down of my (somewhat) popular projects.[^1]

### Ruby

* [RuboCop](https://rubocop.org)
* [Ruby Style Guide](https://github.com/rubocop-hq/ruby-style-guide)

* [Minitest Style Guide](https://github.com/rubocop-hq/minitest-style-guide)

### Clojure

These days (circa 2019) Clojure free software work consumes most of my
time and energy.

I'm the author of a few projects:

* [CIDER](https://cider.mx)
* [cider-nrepl](https://github.com/clojure-emacs/cider-nrepl)
* [orchard](https://github.com/clojure-emacs/orchard)
* [inf-clojure](https://github.com/clojure-emacs/inf-clojure)

And the primary maintainer or a co-maintainer of a ton of commonly
used tools and libraries focused at creating powerful Clojure editing
experience:

* [nREPL](https://nrepl.org)
* [Piggieback](https://github.com/nrepl/piggieback)
* [Drawbridge](https://github.com/nrepl/drawbridge)
* [Fastlane](https://github.com/nrepl/fastlane)
* [cljs-tooling](https://github.com/clojure-emacs/cljs-tooling)
* [clojure-mode](https://github.com/clojure-emacs/clojure-mode)
* [clj-refactor](https://github.com/clojure-emacs/clj-refactor)
* [refactor-nrepl](https://github.com/clojure-emacs/refactor-nrepl)
* [sayid](https://github.com/clojure-emacs/sayid)
* [clojuredocs-edn-export](https://github.com/clojure-emacs/clojuredocs-export-edn)
* [parseclj](https://github.com/clojure-emacs/parseclj)
* [parseedn](https://github.com/clojure-emacs/parseedn)

### Emacs

Emacs is the One True Editor and my biggest life-long obsession. You can safely describe
me as an unreasonable (but powerful) Emacs wielding fanatic!

* [Prelude](https://github.com/bbatsov/prelude)
* [Projectile](https://projectile.mx)
* [Crux](https://github.com/bbatsov/crux)
* [super-save](https://github.com/bbatsov/super-save)
* [guru-mode](https://github.com/bbatsov/guru-mode)
* [rubocop-emacs](https://github.com/bbatsov/rubocop-emacs)
* [Zenburn for Emacs](https://github.com/bbatsov/zenburn-emacs)
* [Solarized for Emacs](https://github.com/bbatsov/solarized-emacs)

## Support Me

Working on free software projects is a lot of fun, but it also takes a
lot of time and energy. I'd love to be able to turn my free software
hobby work into my job, but I'll need a lot of help from you to get
there!

If you like my work consider supporting it by one of those funding platforms:

* [GitHub Sponsors](https://github.com/users/bbatsov/sponsorship)
* [Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/bbatsov)
* [PayPal](https://www.paypal.me/bbatsov)

Thanks!
